Consider an apple and a banana. Although an apple and a banana are different fruits, both have in common that they are fruits. Because apples and bananas are fruits, anything that is true of fruits is also true of apples and bananas. For example, all fruits have a name, a flavor, and are tangible objects. Thus, apples and bananas also have a name, a flavor, and are tangible objects. Apples and bananas inherit these properties from the concept of fruit because they are fruit. Apples and bananas then define some of these properties in different ways (apples and bananas have different flavors), which is what makes them distinct from each other.
