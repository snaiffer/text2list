I. A PUZZLE

Look! This is Pinky. She is white,
but her ears and nose are pink. And
that is Blackie. He has got a grey body
and a black tail. They are very nice and
they are my sister and brother. They
are my friends, too. And this is me. I
am Reddy. I am red, and red is my fa-
vourite colour. We are kittens and we
are little.

We have got a mother. But she is
not with us now. She is with her sister.

Mrs Paw visits and helps us. She is our
mum’s friend.

It is sunny today. We are in the gar-
den now. Pinky is on the swing. She is
swinging. Blackie is in an armchair.
He is reading. And I am in a tree. I am
watching the birds.

Pinky is very happy and she sings.

“Please, Pinky, don’t sing!” says
Blackie. “I can’t read!”

“Don’t read,” says Pinky. “Listen to
my song.”

“But I want to read,” says Blackie.

“And I want to sing!” says Pinky.

Pinky sings and Blackie is very an-
gry. He takes his radio and turns it on.

N ow Pinky is angry. She can’t hear
her song. She jumps down, comes up to
Blackie and turns the radio off.

“Why are you doing that?” she asks.
“Can you read when the radio is sing-
ing?”

Blackie looks at her and says:

“I oa11’t read when the radio is sing-
ing. But you can sing when I am reading.
That is not fair. But now I can't read and
you oan’t sing. It is fair.”

I, Reddy. don’t like when my friends
are not happy. I climb down the tree and
go to them. I come up and say:

“Pinky, you can sing in the house.
Then Blaokie oan"'t hear you and he oan
read. Or Blaekie, you can read in the
house. Then you ean’t hear Pinky and
she can sing in the garden.”

Blackie and Pinky are nice kittens.

“OK, I am going into the house,'”
they say together.
